### Graph genome construction
The graph reference genome was constructed using vg by incorporating the large-scale pan-SV information into 
the linear reference genome of B73 (v5). To reduce the complexity of calculation for following SV genotyping at 
the population level, a subset of SVs (including insertions, deletions and inversions) within
10-kb flanking all annotated genes in B73 were taken for the graph genome construction.
