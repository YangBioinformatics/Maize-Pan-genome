Long-reads alignment (Sniffles and CuteSV) and genome sequence alignment (syri and smarite-sv) were used to identify SV between reference genome (B73) and the remaining 55 genomes.
1.	Sniffles (https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles) and CuteSV  (https://github.com/tjiangHIT/cuteSV)
About 30Ã— raw long-reads sequencing fastq data for each accession was sampled using seqkit (https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit). Then, fastq data of each accession was aligned to B73 (v5) to generated SAM file. These SAM files were further converted to BAM files for following SV calling.
2.	SyRi (https://github.com/schneebergerlab/syri)
3.	Smartie-sv (https://github.com/zeeev/smartie-sv)
