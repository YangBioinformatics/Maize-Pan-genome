### Heritability estimation
LDAK  (https://dougspeed.com/) was used to estimate the heritability for multiple traits using different types 
of genetic variants. These traits included genome-wide gene expressions from eQTL analysis 
 [(Liu et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02069-1), ASI 
[(Liu et al., 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/33/6/2058/6175065)
, survival rate [(Wang et al., 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3636), 
metabolic profiling [(Zhang et al., 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3636) and 
image-based traits [(Wu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02377-0).
