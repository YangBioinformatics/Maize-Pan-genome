### eQTL analysis
eQTL analysis was based on a linear mixed model by incorporating the population structure, kinship coefficients, 
and hidden confounding factors performed by EMMAX (https://csg.sph.umich.edu//kang/emmax/download/index.html)
The population structure was calculated by ADMIXTURE (v1.3) (https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html) and k was set as 4.
The Kinship was calculated by EMMAX and the hidden confounding factors were calculated in our previous work (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02069-1).
