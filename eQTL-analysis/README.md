#### eQTL analysis using a linear mixed model by incorporating the population structure, kinship coefficients, and hidden confounding factors performed by EMMAX (https://csg.sph.umich.edu//kang/emmax/download/index.html)
##### Population structure was calculated by ADMIXTURE (https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html), k was set as 4.
##### Kinship was calculated by EMMAX.
##### The hidden confounding factors was calculated in our previous work (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02069-1).
