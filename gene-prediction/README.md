### Gene prediction
Gene annotation was performed by combining evidence-based and ab initio gene prediction, following the methods 
described in (Hufford et al., 2021). We only conducted minor revises based on scripts uploaded by NAM 
pan-genome research (https://github.com/HuffordLab/NAM-genomes/tree/master/gene-prediction).
